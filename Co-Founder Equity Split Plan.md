# Co-Founder Equity Split Plan

## **1. Initial Equity Split**  
Each co-founder starts with a **minimal equity allocation** to reflect early-stage involvement and potential future contributions:

- **Initial Split**: **1-5% equity** per co-founder
- **Retention**: This equity will be **locked for the first year** and only unlocked after completing the time requirement.

## **2. Vesting Structure**  

To ensure fair equity distribution, the vesting structure combines **time-based** and **performance-based** milestones.

### **Vesting Breakdown**
- **50% Time-Based Vesting**
