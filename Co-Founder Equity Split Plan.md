# Co-Founder Equity Split Plan

## **1. Initial Equity Split**  
Each co-founder starts with a **minimal equity allocation** to reflect early-stage involvement and potential future contributions:

- **Initial Split**: **1-5% equity** per co-founder
- **Retention**: This equity will be **locked for the first year** and only unlocked after completing the time requirement.

---

## **2. Vesting Structure**  

To ensure fair equity distribution, the vesting structure combines **time-based** and **performance-based** milestones.

### **Vesting Breakdown**
- **50% Time-Based Vesting**
- **50% Performance-Based Vesting**

### **2.1 Time-Based Vesting**
- **Vesting Period**: **50% of equity** vests gradually over **4 years**.
- **1-Year Cliff**: No equity vests in the first year; **5% vests after 12 months** of active involvement. The remainder vests gradually thereafter.

| **Time Period** | **Equity Vested** | **Notes**                     |
|------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| Year 0           | 0%                | Initial lock period           |
| Year 1           | 5%                | First unlock                  |
| Year 2           | 10%               | After 1-year cliff            |
| Years 3-4        | Remaining 35%     | Monthly/quarterly thereafter   |

### **2.2 Performance-Based Vesting**  
The remaining **50% of equity** vests based on specific contributions. Here are the key milestones:

| **Milestone**                 | **Description**                        |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Product Development**       | Launch MVP or key product features     |
| **Customer Acquisition**      | Secure first paying customers          |

| **Fundraising**               | Lead or contribute to funding rounds   |
| **Leadership & Strategy**     | Manage teams or guide overall direction |

### **Performance Reviews**

## **3. Salary Structure**

Once the startup reaches consistent revenue, co-founders will begin receiving a salary:

| **Salary Range** | **Description**                               |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| ₹1-5 lakhs        | Adjusted based on region and financial health |
| **Revenue-Tied**  | Only distributed once revenue is sustainable  |

---

## **4. Initial Financing & Loan Terms**

Any co-founder can contribute funds as an **unsecured loan**, ensuring fair compensation later without early financial strain on the startup.

| **Loan Terms**         | **Details**                       |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **No Interest**        | Loan is interest-free              |
| **No Fixed Repayment** | Repayment occurs when profitable   |
| **Optional 5X Return** | Upon profitability, up to **5X** return or principal repayment |

**Example**  
| **Loan Amount** | **Possible Returns (5X)** | **Min. Repayment** |
|-----------------|---------------------------|--------------------|
| ₹10,000         | ₹50,000                   | ₹10,000            |
| ₹1,00,000       | ₹5,00,000                 | ₹1,00,000          |

## **5. Adjusting Equity Over Time**

Equity can be adjusted based on contributions:

- **No Equity Cap**: Co-founders earn equity based on contributions with no predefined maximum.
- **Greater Contributions = More Equity**: This encourages active participation and rewards impactful leadership.

## **6. Founder Exit & Dispute Resolution**

| **Condition**               | **Outcome**                         |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Unvested Equity**         | Retained only for vested portions    |
| **Dispute Resolution**      | Resolved via co-founder agreement     |

---

## **7. Conclusion**  
This equity split plan promotes fairness, flexibility, and long-term motivation for both co-founders. By combining **time-based and performance-based vesting**, it ensures each co-founder contributes meaningfully and is rewarded accordingly.
